# Development

_You will be expected to take an iterative approach to the development of your system. This means that you will need to show your work at different stages. A stage might relate to a step of the project, or it could be a prototype that will be redeveloped in a subsequent stage._

_At each stage, you need to explain what you did and describe any problems that you encountered. At each stage, you also need to show evidence of 'testing to inform development' (see next subsection). **At the end of each stage**, you need to review the work that you have done and explain what decisions you have made about how you plan to take it forward._

_Show the code that you have developed and take screenshots of any associated interface(s). An example of an approach to documenting a stage of the development of your code is shown below. This is a fairly simple example with a single piece of code, and would be highly unlikely to be a whole stage of a project. However, you might have a stage that relates to the design of a particular form (e.g. a user registration form) and the validation of the data that the form collects. The next stage could be the design of the database, and another stage could cover linking the form with the database._

| **Function name:** `validate_email`                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose:** To validate an email address                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Explanation:** Changed the email validation so that it now uses a regular expression to validate an email address instead of manually searching for the position and inclusion of symbols such as '@'. |

Throughout your project, the examiner will be looking for evidence of good coding technique. The table below highlights good practice.

Any variables that you create that are not defined within a function are, by default, global.

| Use of constants                                                                                                                                     | <p>Use constants for defined values that don't change whilst the program is being executed.

In languages that do not have automatic indentation, make sure that you use indentation effectively and consistently to aid readability of your code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Subroutines with appropriate interfaces, and loosely coupled subroutines (code interacts with other parts of the program through its interface only) | A good subroutine takes data only through its parameters and uses return statements. You can ensure that this criterion is met by eliminating any use of global variables in a procedural system, and using private/protected access modifiers for attributes in an OOP system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Modules (collections of subroutines) to group subroutines with a common purpose                                                                      | A module should contain subroutines that belong together. For example, all of your data validation subroutines could be in a validation module. It is good practice to keep each class definition in its own module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Defensive programming, and good exception handling                                                                                                   | All input data must be validated, and all possible errors need to be trapped. For parts of your system that interface with external components, such as data files or APIs, use `try...except` statements to encapsulate any code that could conceivably fail. Create error messages that are meaningful, and if possible, highlight the position of the error for the use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
