# â˜‘ 2.1

The first thing to address of this section is how we are going to verify the input.

RegEx is a commonly used tool to match patterns, and split strings to said patterns. As such, it is a powerful tool for validation -  and far more convenient than having to use array and string methods to attempt to match something as specific as CSS syntax.

Below is the RegEx patterns I defined. There is one for checking the identifier, checking the property, checking the value, and, if needed, checking the hex.

<pre class="language-javascript" data-overflow="wrap"><code class="lang-javascript"><strong>//the following are constant regular expressions that match valid CSS syntax and other expressions.
</strong>const identifierRegEx = new RegExp(/[\w-[\]@:, ]*(?={)/); //matches foo{
const propertyRegEx = new RegExp(/[\w-]*(?=:[\w-%#" ]*(?=;))/); // matches foo:xxxx;
const valueRegEx = new RegExp(/(?&#x3C;=:)[\w\d\s#%()]*(?=;)/); //matches :foo;
const hexRegEx = new RegExp(/(?&#x3C;=#)[\w\d]*/); //matches #foo
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
These will all be defined as Constants, as none of these will be changed.
{% endhint %}

Now all that needs to happen is that the input is retrieved using the HTMLDOM model, and the inbuilt attribute innerHTML() to get the contents of a div- contentEditable being used to allow the user to input in the first place. Then all we need to do is run a validation check against the above RegEx.
