# Existing Solutions

#### FLEXBOX FROGGY - https://flexboxfroggy.com

Flexbox froggy is a rather well-known solution, which teaches a user how to utilise flexbox by having them solve simple alignment puzzles with it.

#### CSS DINER - https://flukeout.github.io

CSS Diner is less known, being a project that I came across on reddit. It is akin to flexbox froggy in the way it has a more fun visual, but it focuses on teaching selectors and holds the users hand a fair bit more.

#### SUPER MARKUP WORLD - https://supermarkupworld.com

Super markup world, unlike the above two solutions, focuses on HTML over CSS- though does rely on inline CSS. It is a platformer and is substantially more gamified than the former examples.

#### CodeCOMBAT - [https://codecombat.com](https://codecombat.com)

CodeCombat is an online game where you solve puzzles, utilising JavaScript, HTML, and Python. It is often used more commercially to learn, and is an incredibly high quality solution.
