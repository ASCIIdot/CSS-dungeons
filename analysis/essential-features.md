# Essential Features

Ø  I will be including the ability to input and parse text as CSS, checking validation and outputting the result if deemed valid. This is essential, as the problem’s solution requires interactivity.

Ø  I will be including an RPG-like GUI, which would set the environment and allow the users to see what the puzzle is, and the possible approaches they can take. This is essential as the solution aims to be as accessible to students as possible, and it being visually appealing is just a bonus. It also allows for room for more creativity, which was mentioned as something that stakeholders would want.

Ø  I will be including a “guide” section that gives the user pointers and assists them in getting started with implementing the CSS. The aim of this after all is to be a learning tool, and the users will need a point of reference to be able to go back to if they are unable to continue or find themselves struggling with the puzzle.

Ø  I will be including a HTML viewport, which allows the user to see the HTML that their CSS will be applying to. This is because I intend on letting the users get to grips with the identifiers that are seen in CSS- notably class and ID.
