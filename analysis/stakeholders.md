# Stakeholders

_The main group who would benefit from such a solution are students, 12-17, who have had little to no prior experience with CSS, though it should be accessible to all ages who are new to CSS._

_The following stakeholders are people who have had an interest with learning programming but have never interacted with text-based programming._

**VN, 16, student**. He has not studied computer science, but has had an interest with web development, being deterred with the lack of resources that allows you to learn in a creative and interactive way. This partially lends to his ADHD which makes dealing with reading just the documentation and keeping streaks in things like _Sololearn_ a hassle. He is interested in a game-like way to learn, as the “stakes” presented will make it a lot easier to stay engaged.

**RO, 13, student.** Raef is a student who does study computer science but does not engage with the programming aspect of the subject as what they are doing seems “pointless and boring” to him. He has done things such as making HTML webpages however he has never been set engaging tasks or challenges to work with. He thinks that if coding was more fun or seemed like it “actually could do anything other than displaying text on a screen in some colour” he would be a lot more ready to learn how to do it. In addition, he spends a lot of time gaming, so the solution would certainly help him work with it.

**JB, 14, student**. She has had an interest with computers for quite some time but has never gotten round to learning how to actually code. She has not used block-based programming languages in the past, unlike the other two stakeholders in this category, thinking that it looks a bit limited, and she’d rather get to grips with the “real stuff”. She still would like a nice introduction before moving to high level languages, C++ being in mind for what she wants to learn. She doesn’t mind if its engaging or not because in the end she can always mess around and learn with an actual IDE and YouTube walkthroughs but doesn’t think it would hurt to have a little bit of a fun introduction.

_The following stakeholders are people who have had experience with programming but would like to test and be involved in the direction regardless. They are willing to make suggestions on what to include as challenges and what important syntax and functions should be utilised. They know they aren’t the target demographic and know it will be a bit simple for them but are willing to give their time to helping out._

**MW, 17, Student.** They are a friend of mine so may be a little biased towards me so they will mostly give opinions on which route to choose and suggestions than critique to prevent such bias interfering with the final product. They know quite a bit about programming, doing it now and again recreationally, and are more than willing to help in what I should include to maximise my projects use as a learning tool.

**WD, 28, Freelance Frontend Programmer.** The only professional stakeholder, they less want to be a user or tester than see the project to the end. He will be helping out on unbiased feedback and is curious about how I will create a final product, and give me advice as to how they would do it given his experience in the field. He will be somewhat acting as quality control.              &#x20;
