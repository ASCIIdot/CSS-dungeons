# Limitations

There are plenty of more ambitious and potentially better solutions than mine- for example including multiplayer for the added edge of competitivity amongst learners, which has been shown as a great incentive. Unfortunately, for me, a single developer, this would be incredibly difficult- not even considering the fact that a server will need to be created and maintained, which I simply do not have the budget for.

Other limitations include:

As a web-based game, it cannot be tested on devices that do not include a browser.

Ø  Some of the libraries and inbuilt functions that can be used in JS and CSS are not compatible with every single browser, so It will only be built with modernity in mind.

Ø  Due to the time limit, I may not be able to include as many stages as I would like to, so this learning tool would not be able to cover every aspect of CSS. It will only serve as a starting point, with only the more commonly used attributed being illustrated and utilised.

Ø  As this solution is focusing on graphics and graphical puzzles, it unfortunately will not be able to be made to be accessible to those using a screen reader.

Ø  Something I considered and ruled out due to it being unreasonably ambitious is the idea of a level creator. This would not be possible to implement at the scale of the project, but if given more time it would be an option, especially if made open source for others to push their own peer-made levels.
